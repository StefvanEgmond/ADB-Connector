# ADB-Connector
Simple Windows batch ADB (Android Debug Bridge) connector for Android phones connected to a Windows machine. I am using this file for Android development, sometimes the phone does not correctly connect to my desktop, therefore I build this file.

Download the .bat file on your PC (Windows) and run the file.
You can use it to start, stop or get the current status of the ADB.

# Features
- Start ADB connection
- Stop ADB connection
- Check the status of ADB
